        <p><i>The man of mystery and charm</i></p>
    </header>

    <section id="appearance">
        <h2>Appearance</h2>
        <img src="OsamuManga.webp" alt="Dazai Image">
        <ul>
            <li>Hair: Dark brown</li>
            <li>Eyes: Brown</li>
            <li>Height: 5'8"</li>
            <li>Distinctive features: Bandages, long coat, scarf</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Dazai is a young man with mildly wavy, short, dark brown hair and narrow dark brown eyes. His bangs frame his
            face, while some are gathered at the center of his forehead. He is quite tall and slim in terms of physique.

            For his attire, Dazai wears a long sand-colored trench coat, the belt of which he leaves untied. Under it is
            a black vest over a striped dress shirt that is light blue in hue. He wears a bolo tie, which is held by a
            brown ribbon and a turquoise pendant. He also dons beige pants, dark brown shoes, and has bandages wrapped
            around his entire body; only his face, hands, and feet are left uncovered.

            Back when he was in the Mafia, Dazai wore a black trench coat that reached under his knees. He also wore
            bandages over his right eye and his right arm is in a sling—presumably products of his suicidal pastimes. At
            some point, he was able to regain the use of his right arm.

            After the cannibalism, Dazai wears a formal suit during the Agency's celebration.

            During the Yokohama fog incident, Dazai wears a white waistcoat over black long sleeves and a brown tie,
            together with white pants. A lapel pin can be also seen attached to his padded overcoat.

            After being arrested by the Hunting Dogs and taken to Meursault, Dazai is currently wearing white prison
            clothes</p>

        <h2>Personality</h2>
        <p>
            Dazai is a mysterious person, his true intentions are never revealed unless he reveals them. The person who
            got closest to the truth of his personality, as acknowledged by Dazai himself, was his friend Sakunosuke
            Oda, who recognized that Dazai shall linger in the darkness forever, as there was nearly nothing that can
            surpass his mind. Regardless whether he is on the side of killing people or saving them, Oda knew that no
            place in the world could fill Dazai's loneliness, which Oda thought Dazai knew in himself.
        </p>

        <img src="Dark Era.jpg" alt="Dark Era" style="height: 400px; width: 400px;">
        <p>In addition, Dazai kept an enigmatic and dark façade, whose endeavors in the Mafia were unrivaled and
            eventually earned him the status as the youngest leader in the history of the Mafia (歴れき代だい最さい年ねん少しょう幹かん部ぶ,
            reki daisainenshō kanbu?). Because of his aptitude despite his youth, Dazai contributed to about half the
            Mafia's profits for at least two years. Eventually, Dazai's ledger became tainted; Ichiyō Higuchi
            describes his blood to be "dark as the Mafia itself". Even in his adulthood when he becomes an Agency
            member, when Kyōka Izumi showed remorse over having killed 35 people, Dazai remarked with a sinister face
            that such number is nothing.

            As a saying in the Mafia went, "The greatest misfortune for Dazai's enemies is that they are Dazai's
            enemies", for Dazai was aptly described to be "practically born to be in the Mafia". He was extremely
            confident and was a terrific planner, coming up with long-run strategies to subdue his enemies. For
            instance, he was able to lure Mimic operatives, who were previously trained soldiers, to fall under his
            trap. Dazai is quite skilled in persuasion notably through his words, which he appeared to utilize in
            interrogations that broke targets who did not divulge anything under Kōyō Ozaki's torture squad. ehind this
            grim persona, Dazai admitted that he joined the Mafia to be exposed to death, violence, and
            people giving in to their urges and desires, expecting that—in this way—he would be able to see the inner
            nature of humankind firsthand in hopes of finding a reason to live. Following Oda's demise, Dazai
            defected from the Mafia and went underground in order to heed Oda's final request for him to "be on the side
            that saves people". Admittedly, he reckoned that people change over time where potential surfaces,
            which apparently seems to apply to himself as well.</p>

        <img src="GASP.png" alt="" style="height: 400px; width: 400px;">
        <p>Upon joining the Agency, Dazai is usually called lazy, with Doppo Kunikida always scolding him for being
            unproductive and slacking off. Despite that, he has shown a sharp wit, deducing all the unlikely situations
            that led Atsushi Nakajima to believe he was being stalked by a tiger when he was the tiger in question.
            He has complete confidence no matter what type of situation he is dealing with, be it combat or simply bad
            situations he formulated in the first place. In most occasions, Dazai is overly dramatic. He takes most of
            his actions as a joke, and, although they are very well-thought plans, he does not credit himself for most
            of what he has done. Dazai likes to tease anyone and everyone, especially if it means that he can get a
            laugh out of it. As a suicide maniac, he often attempts to commit suicide in comical manners, but he
            oftentimes fails or gives up on it when such methods are painful.
            Dazai, in particular, wishes to commit double suicide with a beautiful woman; though he admits
            that he "likes all types of women", he possibly prefers the type who would die with him if he asked to.
            Kunikida once wondered why Dazai is quite popular with women and called him a menace to women, a
            sentiment Chūya Nakahara once used when he threatened to leak Dazai's address to every woman he ever made
            cry, which Dazai soon asked him not to do. Dazai also once had a run-in with a bomb threat instigated by
            a woman whom Dazai figured was obsessed with him.

            While his suicidal tendencies are initially comedic, they reveal a truly dark deep hole that Dazai has. Even
            as a teenage boy, Dazai questioned whether there was any value in life.[9] Thus, he soon tried to fill this
            hole and find a reason worth living for, choosing to live a life surrounded by bloodshed and war, but his
            friend Oda with his dying breath convinced him to choose the good side. He understood that even though good
            and evil mean little to Dazai, he may become a slightly better person if he were to choose well.</p>

        <img src="15.jpg" alt="" style="height: 800px; width: 400px;">
        <p>In the past, while he was still suicidal, it was shown to be far less comedic. He even described the death as
            a way to free himself from the oxidizing world, but, strangely enough, he could not die no matter how hard
            he tried. Additionally, he was extremely brutal and methodical, setting up traps to catch captives alive to
            torture them for information, and he would often beat his then apprentice Ryūnosuke Akutagawa for disobeying
            orders and to push him to the limits to improve his abilities</p>

        <h2>Real-Life Version</h2>
        <p>
            Osamu Dazai (1909–1948) was a Japanese author known for his semi-autobiographical works, exploring themes of
            alienation, depression, and human nature.

        <h2>Skills & Expertise</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Intelligence:</strong> Dazai's intelligence is his primary source of expertise as a Mafia
                executive in the past and as a detective at present. Ōgai Mori, a proficient tactician himself,
                widely trusted and relied on Dazai's intelligence, claiming he would have been his most worthy
                right-hand man had he stayed in the Mafia. Dazai is also recognized as one of the Agency's sharpest
                detectives together with Ranpo, who is proclaimed as the world's greatest detective. He can go
                head-to-head against the formidable Fyodor Dostoevsky, who sees Dazai as quite identical to himself.
                Dazai has an aptitude for predicting outcomes, which he himself admits is one of his strongest
                qualities.</li>

            <li><strong>Negotiation Skills:</strong> Dazai is an adept persuader, able to negotiate with others and
                achieve his required outcomes. He convinced Kōyō, a Mafia executive, to let Kyōka get arrested and
                remain in the Agency as a captive; persuaded Francis Scott Key Fitzgerald, a former enemy, to
                collaborate with him; and even got Akutagawa to tail and potentially help Atsushi before a major
                plot. He also manipulated Naomi Tanizaki into working with him behind her brother's back, though the
                scheme backfired.</li>

            <li><strong>Dexterity:</strong> Dazai is proficient in lock picking, such as prying locked boxes or
                handcuffs open. He was able to implant a bug in Higuchi's pocket unnoticed and swipe Chūya
                Nakahara's knife without being seen. Kunikida described Dazai as "frighteningly dexterous," able to
                pick a bank safe with a needle or easily switch slips of paper with fake ones.</li>

            <li><strong>Physical Prowess:</strong> Dazai had fair-to-middling hand-to-hand skills among the Mafia,
                which his nullification ability compensated for. He could briefly hold his own against Chūya, the
                most physically gifted in the Mafia, by predicting and defending against his moves, though he
                eventually got backed up. He could also fend off a larger man using his surroundings, though being
                overwhelmed later.</li>

            <li><strong>Heart Rate Manipulation:</strong> Using a device monitoring his vitals, Dazai can vary his
                heart rate at will and digitize messages to communicate with the outside world.</li>
        </ul>
