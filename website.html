        <h1>What Are Earthquakes?</h1>
        <p>An earthquake, also called a quake, tremor, or temblor, is the shaking of the Earth's surface resulting
            from a sudden release of energy in the lithosphere that creates seismic waves. Earthquakes can range in
            intensity, from those so weak they cannot be felt, to those violent enough to propel objects and people
            into the air, damage critical infrastructure, and wreak destruction across entire cities. The seismic
            activity of an area is the frequency, type, and size of earthquakes experienced over a particular time.
            The seismicity at a particular location in the Earth is the average rate of seismic energy release per
            unit volume. In its most general sense, the word earthquake is used to describe any seismic event that
            generates
            seismic waves. Earthquakes can occur naturally or be induced by human activities, such as mining,
            fracking, and nuclear weapons testing. The initial point of rupture is called the hypocenter or focus,
            while the ground level directly above it is the epicenter. Earthquakes are primarily caused by
            geological faults, but also by volcanism, landslides, and other seismic events.</p>
        <H1>What Are Floods?</H1>
        <p>A flood is an overflow of water (or rarely other fluids) that submerges land that is usually dry. In
            the sense of "flowing water", the word may also be applied to the inflow of the tide. Floods are of
            significant concern in agriculture, civil engineering and public health. Human changes to the
            environment often increase the intensity and frequency of flooding. Examples for human changes are land
            use changes such as deforestation and removal of wetlands, changes in waterway course or flood controls
            such as with levees. Global environmental issues also influence causes of floods, namely climate change
            which causes an intensification of the water cycle and sea level rise. For example, climate
            change makes extreme weather events more frequent and stronger. This leads to more intense floods and
            increased flood risk. Natural types of floods include river flooding, groundwater flooding coastal
            flooding and urban flooding
            sometimes known as flash flooding. Tidal flooding may include elements of both river and coastal
            flooding processes in estuary areas. There is also the intentional flooding of land that would otherwise
            remain dry. This may take place for agricultural, military, or river-management purposes. For example,
            agricultural flooding may occur in preparing paddy fields for the growing of semi-aquatic rice in many
            countries.</p>
        <h1>What Are Droughts?</h1>
        <p>A drought is a period of drier-than-normal conditions. A drought can last for days, months or
            years. Drought often has large impacts on the ecosystems and agriculture of affected regions, and causes
            harm to the local economy. Annual dry seasons in the tropics significantly increase the chances of
            a drought developing, with subsequent increased wildfire risks.[4] Heat waves can significantly worsen
            drought conditions by increasing evapotranspiration. This dries out forests and other vegetation, and
            increases the amount of fuel for wildfires. Drought is a recurring feature of the climate in most parts
            of the world, becoming more extreme and less
            predictable due to climate change, which dendrochronological studies date back to 1900. There are three
            kinds of drought effects, environmental, economic and social. Environmental effects include the drying
            of wetlands, more and larger wildfires, loss of biodiversity.</p>
